# netherCoordinate-calculator

  A simple coordinate calculator for the nether dimension of Minecraft. Comes as an execuatable .jar file but I'll also post the App and calcWindow files. This project is NOT finished.
I plan on making it look nicer, adding reverse functionality, and it is missing error messages. As of now it uses a simple function to read in X and Z coordinates, divide them by eight, and display
the new coordinates back. The program is written in java, and was done so on the VS IDE.
  Usage is simple. Just download and run the program, enter your coordinates, and hit the button! (Coordinates are rounded to the nearest whole number).
