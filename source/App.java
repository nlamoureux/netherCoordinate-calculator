/*
This program is a coordiunate calculator for the game Minecraft. It is meant to translate coordinates in the overworld dimension, to those
 * of the nether dimension. It consists of two files: the main file that launches the application, and the file containing the construction of
 * the window, as well as the function for coordinate conversion. The program takes whole numbers only, as decimals are not important in Minecraft.
